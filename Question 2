Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describes a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. 1,4,9,16,25.

Example

a = 24

b = 49

There are three square integers in the range: 25, 36, and 49. Return 3.

Function Description

Complete the squares function in the editor. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from a to b.

squares have the following parameter(s):

int a: the lower range boundary
int b: the upper range boundary
Returns

int: the number of square integers in the range
Input Format

First-line contains two space-separated integers, a and b, the starting and ending integers in the ranges.


Sample Input:

3 9

Sample Output:

2

    public static int squares(int a, int b){
        int count=0;
        for(int i=a;i<=b;i++){
           int j=1;
           while(j<i){
               if(i%j==0 && i/j==j){
                   count++;
               }
               j++;
           }
        }
        return count;
       
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=scan.nextInt();
        int b=scan.nextInt();
        System.out.print(squares(a,b));
    }
}
